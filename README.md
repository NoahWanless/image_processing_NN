# image_processing_NN
Image Processing Neural Network along with additional image and face capturing functions

IMPORTANT NOTE:
I am not very good at this and am just a noice coder, so when using, expect things to break and potentially not work.
Also, this is more of a proof of concept made to further my understanding of Neural Network's and of python in general,
as such this model and the set up in general is not very efficent and is VERY slow.
Thank you however for deciding to check it out anyways!

PS:
i am no longer working on this project, so expect no further update/fixing issues/anything
